The inorder traversal algorithm has several important applications. When using a binary tree to represent an arithmetic expression, as in Figure 8.18, the inorder traversal visits positions in a consistent order with the standard representation of the expression, as in 3 +1×3/9−5+2...(albeit without parentheses). 332 Chapter 8. Trees Binary Search Trees An important application of the inorder traversal algorithm arises when we store an ordered sequence of elements in a binary tree, deﬁning a structure we call a binary search tree .L e t Sbe a set whose unique elements have an order relation. For example, Scould be a set of integers. A binary search tree for Sis a binary tree T such that, for each position pofT: •Position pstores an element of S, denoted as e(p). •Elements stored in the left subtree of p(if any) are less than e(p). •Elements stored in the right subtree of p(if any) are greater than e(p). An example of a binary search tree is shown in Figure 8.19. The above properties assure that an inorder traversal of a binary search tree Tvisits the elements in nondecreasing order. 362531 42 1262 7558 90 Figure 8.19: A binary search tree storing integers. The solid path is traversed when searching (successfully) for 36. The dashed path is traversed when searching (un- successfully) for 70. We can use a binary search tree Tfor set Sto ﬁnd whether a given search value vis in S, by traversing a path down the tree T, starting at the root. At each internal position pencountered, we compare our search value vwith the element e(p)stored at p.I f v<e(p), then the search continues in the left subtree of p. Ifv=e(p), then the search terminates successfully. If v>e(p), then the search continues in the right subtree of p. Finally, if we reach an empty subtree, the search terminates unsuccessfully. In other words, a binary search tree can be viewed as abinary decision tree (recall Example 8.6), where the question asked at each internalnode is whether the element at that node is less than, equal to, or larger than the element being searched for. We illustrate several examples of the search operation in Figure 8.19. Note that the running time of searching in a binary search tree Tis proportional to the height of T. Recall from Proposition 8.8 that the height of a binary tree with nnodes can be as small as log (n+1)−1 or as large as n−1. Thus, binary\n",

      "recursive call may start two others, we call this a binary recursion . •If a recursive call may start three or more others, this is multiple recursion . 4.4.1 Linear Recursion If a recursive function is designed so that each invocation of the body makes at most one new recursive call, this is know as linear recursion . Of the recursions we have seen so far, the implementation of the factorial function (Section 4.1.1) andthegood ﬁbonacci function (Section 4.3) are clear examples of linear recursion. More interestingly, the binary search algorithm (Section 4.1.3) is also an example oflinear recursion , despite the “binary” terminology in the name. The code for binary search (Code Fragment 4.3) includes a case analysis with two branches that lead to recursive calls, but only one of those calls can be reached during a particularexecution of the body. A consequence of the deﬁnition of linear recursion is that any recursion trace will appear as a single sequence of calls, as we originally portrayed for the factorialfunction in Figure 4.1 of Section 4.1.1. Note that the linear recursion terminol- ogy reﬂects the structure of the recursion trace, not the asymptotic analysis of the running time; for example, we have seen that binary search runs in O(logn)time. Summing the Elements of a Sequence Recursively Linear recursion can be a useful tool for processing a data sequence, such as a Python list. Suppose, for example, that we want to compute the sum of a sequence,S,o fnintegers. We can solve this summation problem using linear recursion by observing that the sum of all nintegers in Sis trivially 0, if n=0, and otherwise that it is the sum of the ﬁrst n−1i n t e g e r si n Splus the last element in S.( S e e Figure 4.9.) 4362893285172835 701234 6789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 Figure 4.9: Computing the sum of a sequence recursively, by adding the last number to the sum of the ﬁrst n−1. 170 Chapter 4.

A recursion trace of the linear sum function for a small example is given in Figure 4.10. For an input of size n,t h elinear sum algorithm makes n+1 function calls. Hence, it will take O(n)time, because it spends a constant amount of time performing the nonrecursive part of each call. Moreover, we can also see that the memory space used by the algorithm (in addition to the sequence S)i sa l s o O(n),a s we use a constant amount of memory space for each of the n+1 activation records in the trace at the\n",
